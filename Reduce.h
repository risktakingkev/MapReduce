Phase 1 - Reduce Header
4/20/2023

This class was created in part of creating the MapReduce code for Phase 1 for
CSE 687. The Reduce class's primary purpose is to consolidate all of the data that has been gather thus far.

Since this is the header portion of the class, this will declar all methods and members that the .cpp file
will use.
